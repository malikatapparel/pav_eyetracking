# Eye-Tracking Repository
This repository contains a proof-of-concept eye-tracking algorithm focused on webcam-based pupil detection and tracking in video recordings. It processes eye region videos to detect pupil contours and visualize gaze movements.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Main eye-tracking algorithm code
- `data/raw/` - Original eye movement video files
- `data/processed/` - Output videos with eye-tracking overlays
